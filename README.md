# LeanFixedNavbar
Need a simple, responsive, fixed navbar without all that extra Bootstrap code?  Try this spiffy option!  

This package includes the HTML, Sass (also cimpiled as CSS), JS, and icon image for a fixed navbar.  
The goal here was to include the minimum code needed for this feature - no extra Bootstrap baggage.  
Following mobile-first design, this navbar begins with the menu hidden, revealed (via JS) when a navicon is clicked.
